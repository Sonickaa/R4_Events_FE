        We're an open and tolerant place. <br /> No homophobia, no transphobia,
        no racism, no sexism, no bodyshaming, no violence. <br /> If you
        encounter or experience any of these situations during our event, please
        come to us. <br /> Even if you are not sure, if something felt
        uncomfortable, don't hesitate to ask us. <br />
        Consent is sexy. <br /> Communicate clearly, get a clear yes, give a
        clear no. If somebody doesn't understand these simple words, let us
        know. <br /> Look after each other and have fun!
