      <h3>WE NEED YOU!</h3>
      <p className="double-break">
        Dear Raumvier friends, <br /> <br />
        We come to you with very distressing news. <br /> As you know, we are a
        small "undergroundish" party in the basement of KitKat Club, using the
        less known left side entrance (just next to the main entrance). However,
        from January onwards, we will have to "compete" with another event that
        will happen simultaneously in the upper section of the club.
        <br /> <br /> What is the problem? <br /> <br />
        The concept of this party is a photo allowed twin version of our
        essence, which we've built with you through our life together. (they
        promise similar techno, awareness team, sex positivity...) which means
        they are directly targeting a great deal of our guests. <br /> <br />
        We come to you with this awful information because we are sadly
        predicting around 50% of our guests will prefer to buy a ticket online
        or upstairs and have pictures of the insides of the mysterious club,
        rather than enter a hidden dimension where music, freedom and pure
        expression are the authority.
        <br /> <br /> In a time oversaturated with pictures and social media,
        the chance of being present and being able to connect with a community
        without our phones at hand it's a cornerstone of Raumvier. We are sure
        this fact alone will keep the right people with us. However, the
        malicious intent of trying to make these parties compete means that some
        people will queue "by default" for the most known entrance. <br />{" "}
        <br />
        At this time, we strip naked in front of you once again with all
        honesty: losing guests could mean the end of the space that we've worked
        so hard to build up. We can't afford this hit, much less when it
        endangers the retribution that we ethically share with the whole team
        that is behind our party. Raumvier is a party made by ravers for ravers.
        Our goal was always to create a party that we love to party in, with
        you, together. We are dancers, not competitors or business people.{" "}
        <br /> <br />
        We want to keep creating this magical space for you every month, with a
        spirit that is in tune with the freedom and safety that has
        characterized our scene through the years. It's with this in mind that
        we bring you this heartbreaking news, because the future of this
        communal space IT'S IN YOUR HANDS. <br /> <br />
        It's the happy faces that we've seen at every single one of our parties
        that gives us the push to continue fighting, and YOU HAVE THE POWER to
        keep Raumvier alive.
        <br /> <br /> How? TOGETHER! We need you to be our voice… we need you to
        spread the music and the kink of Raumvier all over the streets and let
        the dancefloor scream! <br /> <br />
        Raumvier is left as always, left side entrance / vorne links, you tell
        your friends, leave your phones at the entrance, and see your sexy
        selves on the 18th. Thank you for your time and moves ❤
